# Generating and reading QR Codes with Xamarin.Forms

### Description
In this demo, we will use [ZXing.Net.Mobile for Forms](https://components.xamarin.com/gettingstarted/zxing.net.mobile.forms) to generating and reading QR Codes in our Xamarin.Forms application.

The first goal is to use the **ZXingBarcodeImageView** class to generate a QR code into a ContentView.


The second goal is to use the **ZXingScannerPage** class to get the information after scanning an image with the device/emulator camera.

### This sample requires either:

- Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 (with Xamarin tools installed)
